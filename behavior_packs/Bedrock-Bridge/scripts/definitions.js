 * Developed by Esploratori-Development https://discord.gg/A2SDjxQshJ
 * This module provides additional scripting capabilities known as bridgeAPI
 * which you can use to modify and enhance BedrockBridge capabilities, and
 * overall bedrock experience in general. We don't only provide tools to handle
 * BedrockBridge, but also generally useful scripting tools, which you can use to 
 * achieve your goals while writing a bridge-plugin.
 * You are encouraged to share your bridge-plugins with Esploratori-Dev community, 
 * you can upload your work in
 * https://github.com/InnateAlpaca/BedrockBridge/tree/main/bridge_plugins
 * 
 * Full **documentation can** be found at 
 * https://github.com/InnateAlpaca/BedrockBridge/blob/main/docs/bridgeAPI/esploratori_bridge.md
 * and the following code also fully documents all enahncements available.
 * 
 * Uniquely use this tool for bridge-plugins. If you wish to include part of this code in
 * your own addons ask BedrockBridge developers https://bedrockbridge.esploratori.space/Contact.html.
 * 
 * Donations are welcome in https://www.gofundme.com/f/bedrockbridge-v20
