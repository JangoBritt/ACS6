/**
 * stepCounter (Players walking distance) - BedrockBridge Plugin
 * 
 * This bridge plugin lets you inquiry the distance a player has been walking on a server.
 * It handles info as scoreboard, so you can gather it from discord by running /stats.
 * You have two scoreboards: one for session time (in minutes), the other for overall time (in minutes). 
 * The latter is updated when the player leaves the server, while the first is updated each minute.
