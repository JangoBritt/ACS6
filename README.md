This is the GitHub Repository for AthosCraft Season 6

Here, we have working collaboratively to prepare, and update packs, addons, and settings for the world, in order to help make administration easier for all involved.

If you find issues within the world, you can raise an issue here on GitHub, and then we can track it, so that we know what we are working on, and what we've fixed.

Happy Minecrafting!
